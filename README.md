This repository collects a series of [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) usage examples, using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create a local Kubernetes cluster and [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/) as controller.

These are just examples to try out the Gateway API and are not meant to be used in a production environment.

# Environment setting
## Create cluster
The `kind-cluster/cluster.yaml` files creates a kind cluster mapping the `30000` port of your local machine to the `30000` port of the node. This port will be used later on as the `envoy` NodePort. Once the cluster is created. Create the namespaces needed for the examples.

```
kind create cluster --config kind-cluster/cluster.yaml
kubectl apply -f kind-cluster/namespaces.yaml
```

## Deploy the Gateway API CRDs
We deploy version 0.6.0 from the experimental channel:

```
kubectl apply -f gateway-api
```

## Deploy Contour
Deploy Contour (the nightly builds) to use it as Gateway API controller:

```
kubectl apply -f contour/contour.yaml
```

Once Contour is deployed, create the default GatewayClass for the examples:

```
kubectl apply -f contour/gatewayclass.yaml
```

## Deploy ecommerce application
Deploy version 1.0 of the ecommerce application on namespace `ns1` and version 2.0 on namespace `ns2`:

```
kubectl apply -f ecommerce/version1/ -n ns1
kubectl apply -f ecommerce/version2/ -n ns2
```

## (Optional) Deploy the Datadog Agent

The ecommerce application is already instrumented with OpenTelemetry. If you are a Datadog user you can send the Otel traces to Datadog by deploying the Datadog Agent:

```
export DD_API_KEY=<YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY>
helm install datadog --set datadog.apiKey=$DD_API_KEY datadog/datadog -f datadog/values.yaml
```

As it is OpenTelemetry, feel free to set up a different backend for the OpenTelemetry traces.

## Edit /etc/hosts
The examples below use `store.example.com` as the hostname for the routes. Edit your local `/etc/hosts` file to point to localhost on that one:

```
127.0.0.1       store.example.com
```

# Examples
For every example, once the resources are created, access the application on `http://store.example.com:30000`

## Basic ([`basic` folder](https://github.com/arapulido/gateway-api-examples/tree/main/basic))
The most basic example deploys a Gateway in the namespace `nsgw` and a HTTPRoute in `ns1`.

Once the resources have been created, access the version 1 of the application on `http://store.example.com:30000`. 

## URLRewrite ([`prefix-urlrewrite` folder](https://github.com/arapulido/gateway-api-examples/tree/main/prefix-urlrewrite))
This example showcases how to split traffic based on URL prefixes, but rewriting the path for the backend to get a root (`/`) prefix.

![Architecture of example 2](./img/example2.jpg)

Once the resources have been created, access the version 1 of the application on `http://store.example.com:30000/foo` and the version 2 of the application on `http://store.example.com:30000/bar`.

## Traffic Weight ([`traffic-weight` folder](https://github.com/arapulido/gateway-api-examples/tree/main/traffic-weight))
This example showcases how to split traffic by weight and how to cross namespaces boundaries safely using ReferenceGrant resources.

![Architecture of example 3](./img/example3.jpg)

Once the resources have been created, access the application on `http://store.example.com:30000/`. 80% of the times you get version 1 and 20% of the times you get version 2.
